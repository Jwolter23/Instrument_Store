## General Overview

- Instrument Store is going to be an ecommerce store that as you can guess, focuses on sell various instruments.
- To begin with, we plan on using around 4-5 models consisting of a User, Instrument, Review, Comment, and Cart.
- The amount of models is subject to change based on needs and how our progression goes.
- Users will be greeted by a login page with the option to log in and acess their cart, or browse the website as a guest.
- We will be implementing an admin page on the front end that will have the privledge to manipulate instruments, prices, reviews, and comments.
- The Instruments tab will take users to a page focused on various instruments categories as well as a search bar if users know the specific brand and type of instruments they would like to purchase.
- Clicking on an Instrument will give the user the ability to read more about it, see reviews, and add it to their cart.
- The Cart section will show users which instruments they added to their cart, along with the sub total and total.
- Reviews will be under every Instrument and will show the reviewers username along with whatever message they add in about said instrument.
- Reviews will be the first area that we tackle full CRUD, then moving on to comments and other models.
- Finally we plan on adding in a comments section that can be anonymous or under someones username that lets our classmates or visters to the website let us know what they think of our site.

## Styling

- We plan on making a classy website that caters to those who are interested in buying top-tier instruments.
- We will be sticking to fairly neutral colors but will include features that allow users to hear a brief note of the instrument when clicked on.
- Grid will be utilized quite a lot as it can help us be consistent and clean.
- We will have a big focus on styling and creating a welcoming website.

## Logic and Tech

- Right now we do not have any plans to use an API but will consider it once MVP is achieved.
- Much of the logic is going to come from the back-end as it will be important to correctly set up our ERD so minimal updating will be needed in the future.
- We plan to really have a lot of information in our ERD as our website will have a lot of data.

## Post MVP

- One goal we hope to acheive is getting Auth created and having a fully functioning login system in place.
- We may also look into utilizing an API if we find it needed.
- We will also be doing more research on UI libraries and implementing if we desire.
